__The Compiler Tool Chain__  
The _compiler tool chain_ is a collection of the three elements that un one after the other to convert source code into a program:

2. The __Compiler__ reads the translation unit and generated an _object file__  
3. The __Linker__ generates programs from object files.  

You can compile an run  C++ code online using [wandbox.org](https://wandbox.org/). Another online editor, [godbolt.org](https://www.godbolt.org/) also allows you to inspect the assembly code that your code generates. Both work on a variety of compilers and systems.
